pyCNN-LSTM
**********

pyCNN-LSTM is a Python library that contains a wide range of models for working with time-series data
using hybrid deep learning models that uses both a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN). The use of these models allow both to capture the spatial features and the time
dependencies between timesteps.

Installation
============

To install pyCNN-LSTM, we recommend using ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyCNN-LSTM
